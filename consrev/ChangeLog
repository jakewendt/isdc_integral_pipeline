NOTE:  Rev pipeline executables don't all compile in the WCT environment due to root not working on the intel compiler.

I have made the mods for SCREW 1769 for this component, but the SCREW has yet to be accepted. This SCREW has nothing to do with the function of this pipeline. It just creates an additional small script that would be copied to ISDC_ENV/bin, if "make install" were run, that will give the version when given the --v option.


20070905 - Jake
	using HEADAS instead of LHEASOFT in unit_test



20070608 - Jake
	SCREW 1988 - merged crvidp and crvirn resource files to ensure that all idps are processed before any irns

20051028 - Jake
	SCREW 1769 - modified makeisdc1.in file to copy the perl script
		the prints the component version to the $ISDC_ENV/bin directory

20051020 - Jake
	Had to add source $LHEASOFT/lhea-init.csh to unit test
		because of addition of fdump to cons_ssa_start.sh

	SPR 4291 - many mods to help consrev auto trigger and auto clean stuff

20050428 - Jake
	The IC Tree will no longer be versioned
	Therefore, I am creating a couple generic scripts
	to be called from unit_tests to do some universal
	things including the creation of a "versioned" IC Tree.

20050414 - Jake
	linux unit test crashes on irem_obt_calc 0024_20021226220109_00_ire, 0024_20021226230117_00_ire, 0025_20021227070629_00_ire
