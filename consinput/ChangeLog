I have made the mods for SCREW 1769 for this component, but the SCREW has yet to be accepted. This SCREW has nothing to do with the function of this pipeline. It just creates an additional small script that would be copied to ISDC_ENV/bin, if "make install" were run, that will give the version when given the --v option.

20071025 - Jake
	new test_data created using Preproc 4.2

20070226 - Jake

	SCREW 1769 - implementing makeisdc2 files to include only
		COMPONENT_NAME and _VERS.  makeisdc1(.in) will be generic
		and create the actual "component" file.

20051028 - Jake
	SCREW 1769 - modified makeisdc1.in file to copy the perl script
		the prints the component version to the $ISDC_ENV/bin directory

20050829 - Jake
	removed from SCREW 1704 as there were only changes to unit test

20050428 - Jake
	The IC Tree will no longer be versioned
	Therefore, I am creating a couple generic scripts
	to be called from unit_tests to do some universal
	things including the creation of a "versioned" IC Tree.

20050413 - Jake
	unit test seems to work on linux with no differences

20050412 - Jake
	SCREW 1704 - Linux compatibility
		modified unit_tests to check OS
