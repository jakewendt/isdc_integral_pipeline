NOTE : convert_program fails on the timeline summary file TSF_0011_SSSSSSSSSSSSS_0002.INT on isdclin6/gcc, but does work on the intel compiler.  This is irrelevant as adp will never be run on a linux machine.  I have written SPR 4439 regarding this, just in case it is a sign of a deeper problem.

20070226 - Jake
	modification of unittest.data.csh to use /isdc/ic_tree/

20061212 - Jake
	Reorganized perldoc info into code and comments in adpst.pl, adpfin.pl, adpmon.pl and adp.pl

20061211 - Jake
	changed all die's in adp.pl and adpst.pl to either ISDCLIB::Error or, with a command, ISDCLIB::DoOrDie
		(none in adpfin.pl and NOT in adpmon.pl because no OSF log file)
	These functions more clearly describe the problem when they are called.  die simply dies
		and only shows a message in the process log and not the OSF log.
