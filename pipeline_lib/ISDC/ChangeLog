	I think that some of the OSF and Trigger functionality could be 'objectified.'

	I began trying to create more maintainable code by going OO.
	Unfortunately, most of the ISDC code isn't really 'objectifiable.'
	Level.pm is a small package used for finding the previous processing level.
	The modules here are empty and serve no purpose (except Level.pm)
		for the time being.  There is no reason to feel the need to use
		them and only them and not create others.
