I have made the mods for SCREW 1769 for this component, but the SCREW has yet to be accepted. This SCREW has nothing to do with the function of this pipeline. It just creates an additional small script that would be copied to ISDC_ENV/bin, if "make install" were run, that will give the version when given the --v option.

20050428 - Jake
	The IC Tree will no longer be versioned
	Therefore, I am creating a couple generic scripts
	to be called from unit_tests to do some universal
	things including the creation of a "versioned" IC Tree.
