* 2003-06-26, rev 85 [JR]:
 ASM (1.2-12 keV) light curve overview shows high variability from quiescence
 to a flaring level of about 350 mCrab (1.2-12 keV)

* 2004-05-12, rev 192 [PK]:
 Quoting from a proposal of Andrea Santangelo (with us as CoIs):
 "The X-ray luminosity ... has been observed to vary by a factor of 8-10
 on a timescale of of 170 days ...".
 The high luminosity state is 4.3E37 ergs/s for an assumed distance of 8 kpc.
 If I haven't made a mistake right now, this should cover the 500-600 mCrab nicely.
